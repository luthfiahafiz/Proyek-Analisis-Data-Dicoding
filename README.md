## Tentang Proyek
This project aims to fulfill the graduation requirement of Dicoding's "Learning Data Analysis with Python" module by using the Bike Sharing Dataset. This dataset contains information about the usage of bike sharing systems in Washington, D.C. from 2010 to 2012. The data includes information about trips, weather, days, stations, and other features.

In this project, the Bike Sharing dataset is used to find out the effect of temperature, humidity, rainfall, and wind speed on the number of bike borrowings and the effect of bike borrowing patterns on the time of day.
The influence of bicycle lending patterns on lending time and duration can be used to optimize the allocation of bicycle lending and returning stations.
